Tood-o (Working Title)

A simple and interactive to-do list application built for modern web use.
Live Demo: https://tood-o-u41a.vercel.app/

✨ Features

Add, edit, and remove tasks.

Mark tasks as completed/incomplete.

Responsive UI, works on desktop & mobile.

Persistent storage (e.g., using localStorage or a backend).

Clean, minimal design for productivity.

🧱 Tech Stack

Frontend: React (or your chosen framework)

Styling: CSS / SCSS / Tailwind (adjust accordingly)

Data storage: localStorage or API backend

Deployment: Vercel (static/site-hosting)

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (version ≥ 14 recommended)

npm or yarn

Installation
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
npm install

Running in development
npm run dev


Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the port your dev server uses).

Build & Production
npm run build
npm run start


Or if configured for static export:

npm run export

🧩 How it Works

The UI shows an input field for adding a new task.

Tasks are stored (locally or via backend).

Each task item shows: title, completion toggle, edit/delete controls.

Completed tasks can be visually differentiated (strikethrough, faded, etc.).

On reload, tasks persist (via localStorage key such as tasks or via API).

Responsive layout: tasks stack vertically on mobile, side/list view on larger screens.

Adjust file names according to your stack (JS, TS, etc).

🛠️ Useful Notes

If using localStorage: wrap all reads/writes in a try/catch to handle unavailable storage (e.g., incognito mode).

If you later migrate to a backend API: keep the same useTasks hook interface and swap the storage implementation.

You may want to debounce input changes for edits to reduce frequent writes.

For mobile UX: ensure tapping outside forms closes them; support keyboard for accessibility.

🧪 Testing

Unit tests for hook logic (adding/removing tasks, toggling completion).

Snapshot or component tests for UI states (empty list, tasks exist, all completed).

Manual QA: mobile viewport, latest browsers, keyboard navigation.

📦 Scripts (adjust if you use Vite, Next.js, etc)
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}

🌐 Deployment

Deployed via Vercel: push changes to your Git repo, link to Vercel, auto-build & deploy.
Ensure any environment variables (if using backend) are set in your Vercel dashboard.
